## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

We develop **innovative systems and procedures for diagnostics and medical monitoring**, with an emphasis on:
- **Biomechanical & electrophysiological movement analysis**
- **Electrophysiological analysis of brain activity** (EEG/MEG)
- **Sensor development**, signal processing, and AI-driven interpretation
- Applications in **neurology, cardiology, sports science, and human-computer interaction**

Our approach is **user-centered, reproducible, and grounded in open science**.

## End-to-End EEG Analysis Pipeline

We provide a fully automated, modular pipeline for high-density (280-channel) EGI EEG data via **Hugging Face Spaces**:

| Stage | App | Function |
|------|-----|--------|
| **1. Preprocessing** | [**ICA_Xtra**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/ICA_Xtra) | Bad channel detection, ICA-based artifact removal, filtering |
| **2. Source Estimation** | [**LCMV_Xtra**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/LCMV_Xtra) | LCMV beamformer on fsaverage, DiFuMo time series extraction |
| **3. Functional Connectivity** | [**FC_Xtra**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CIMT/FC_Xtra) | Debiased WPLI connectivity across 87 cognitive/motor regions |

âœ… **No manual intervention required**  
âœ… **Reproducible, standardized, and zero-config**  
âœ… Designed for **batch processing** and **non-expert users**
